Cheat Engine is a free and open-source software that lets you scan and change the memory of any process running on your computer. You can use it to hack almost any game or application, as long as you know what you are doing. In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Black Box.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Cheat Engine
 
The first thing you need to do is to download and install Cheat Engine from its official website: [https://www.cheatengine.org/](https://www.cheatengine.org/). Follow the instructions on the screen and choose the default settings. Once the installation is complete, launch Cheat Engine from your desktop or start menu.
 
## Step 2: Launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Black Box
 
The next step is to launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - Black Box from your game folder or shortcut. You can play either single-player or multiplayer mode, depending on your preference. Once the game is running, minimize it and go back to Cheat Engine.
 
## Step 3: Select the Game Process
 
In Cheat Engine, click on the computer icon on the top left corner to open the process list. Scroll down and look for the process named "iw4sp.exe" or "iw4mp.exe", depending on whether you are playing single-player or multiplayer mode. Select it and click "Open".
 
## Step 4: Scan for Values
 
Now comes the fun part. In Cheat Engine, you can scan for any value that you want to change in the game, such as your health, ammo, score, etc. For example, if you want to have unlimited health, you need to find out what value represents your health in the game memory. To do this, you need to use the scan function in Cheat Engine.
 
First, go back to the game and check your current health value. Let's say it is 100. Then, go back to Cheat Engine and enter 100 in the "Value" box. Make sure the "Scan Type" is set to "Exact Value" and the "Value Type" is set to "4 Bytes". Then, click "First Scan". This will scan the game memory for any address that has a value of 100.
 
After a few seconds, you will see a list of addresses on the left panel. These are all the possible addresses that have a value of 100 in the game memory. However, not all of them are related to your health. To narrow down the results, you need to change your health value in the game and scan again.
 
Go back to the game and take some damage or heal yourself until your health value changes. Let's say it is now 80. Then, go back to Cheat Engine and enter 80 in the "Value" box. Make sure the "Scan Type" is set to "Exact Value" and the "Value Type" is set to "4 Bytes". Then, click "Next Scan". This will scan only the addresses that have changed from 100 to 80.
 
You will see that the list of addresses on the left panel has reduced significantly. Repeat this process until you have only one or a few addresses left. These are most likely related to your health value in the game.
 
## Step 5: Change Values
 
Once you have found the address or addresses that represent your health value in the game memory, you can change them to whatever you want. For example, if you want to have unlimited health, you can change them to a very high number, such as 9999.
 
To do this, select the
